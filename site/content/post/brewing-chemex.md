The most recent topic that has been discussed is the installation of cameras. The proposal has been to install one camera at the entrance, one at the exit and one overlooking the park. We have been in touch with Thames Valley Police to discuss this proposal, and TVP have initially advised that this course of action is likely illegal. 

However, a meeting between an officer from TVP and the committee has been arranged for early October. Further details regarding the outcome of this meeting will be shared in the future, including exactly what is illegal, and what can be done.

On 02/08/2019 we had an on-site meeting with our local MP -Alok Sharma, Taylor Wimpey and Trinity to discuss a number of items:

## New traffic plates to enforce one way system.

TW made it clear that they will be installing a replacement to the old ‘dragons teeth’ which were damaging cars. We communicated to TW what the residents want from the replacement to the spikes. (A flat system which will not be so harsh on cars, I.e plates not spikes. And a system which can be ‘locked down’ during emergencies, for instance if there is a car accident on one side of the development. TW will send 2/3 options to the executive committee who will then judge which option is in the best interests of the residents.

TW agreed to pay for 100% of this cost themselves. 

## Speed bumps. 

We are aware of the speeding issues and shared this issue at the meeting. TW advised that it looks unlikely that TW will be able to install speed bumps, due to regulatory reasons. According to TW, new roads have to be designed in a particular way to accommodate speed bumps. As our road has now been completed it looks like it is too late to install speed bumps. However, TW agreed to explore this option further and confirm whether anything may be possible.

## New signage across the development, e.g road, children park and car park signage

TW have agreed to put a ‘private road’ sign at the entrance of the development.

Further to that, TW have devolved any further requested signage as a matter for Trinity to resolve. We will be engaging on this matter with Trinity in due course. 

The executive committee are looking to install the signs which have been requested by various residents, while simultaneously keeping the number of new signs to as low a number as possible. 

## Parking permit system, to stop illegally parked cars.

We are aware of a number of trade cars illegally parked in the development. Trinity suggested in the meeting that they could introduce a parking permit system to resolve this issue, which would be free of charge to residents. 

This topic however merits further discussion, as a permit system would be a major change to what residents are used to. We would hold a vote for all CWRA members on this matter before proceeding in any way.

Once we have received further info from Trinity on a permit system the executive committee will consult on this matter further with residents.

## Improving disabled/buggy access 

Some residents with buggies or wheelchairs currently find accessing the development at the entrance pathway difficult, due to the pathway being unfinished.

During the on-site meeting, the TW representative suggested that the reason the pathway may be unfinished, was because of a nearby large tree which the planning permissions may have stipulated needs protecting.

TW did however agree to investigate this and confirm whether that is the case, and whether anything can be done to improve the access on this pathway.

# Next steps 

At the end of the on-site meeting, TW and Trinity agreed to send to the MP’s office a summary of the meeting and what each had agreed to do. Both summarys are to be sent to the MP’s office, where if content, they will then pass them to the CWRA executive committee.

To date, the MP’s office has only received the summary from TW. Once we have received all the information from the MP’s office we will advise you with a further update.

If you would like any further information regarding the above please respond to this email, as oppose to going through the WhatsApp group. 

Please note we may not respond to emails straight away, in case there are any repeat questions. 

Kind regards,
